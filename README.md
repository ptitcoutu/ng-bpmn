ng-bpmn
=======

Angular services which are able to check and manage BPMN semantics and diagrams of an XML bpmn definitions file

NB : Experimental project


Main principles
===============
* Retained approach
Use of X2JS and a modified version of angular-xml in order to manipulate BPMN definitions using javascript object.

* First approach (to be clarified)

readBPMNDefinitions service allow to parse and check an XML string against the BPMN XSD and produce a simple javascript object representation of the semantics and diagrams with link between diagrams and semantics. The readBPMNDefinitions service is generated by a code generator.

writeBPMNDefinitions service allow to check js object and write it back to a string containing the definitions in XML format. Like the readBPMNDefinitions, writeBPMNDefinitions service is generated by a code generator.

In order to simplify code maintenance, the code generator has been writen in pure javascript.

The code generator is executed from a browser (no needs to execute nodes.js) to get both services.

How to use demo
